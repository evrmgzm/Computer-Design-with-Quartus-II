Computer has 9 registers, 3 memories, arithmetic and logic unit, control unit and bus system. 

Basic computer has 9 registers which are Address Register, Program Counter, Stack Pointer, Input Register, Output Register, Instruction Register and 3 general purpose registers. 
In computer, there are two memories, which are instruction (32x11), data (16x4) and stack (16x5) Each has “read enable” signals and “data inputs”. Data and stack memory also has “write enable input”. 
Common bus system will be responsible for data flow and provide data transfer between register and/or memories. In ALU, arithmetic and logical operations will be held. Control unit processes instructions to direct the micro-operations for computer's memories, registers and arithmetic/logic unit.  Control unit consists of decoders and a number of control logic gates. It should produce operation signals and time periods for fetching, decoding and executing the instructions.
